`GET /v1/media/operations/{id}`

Requires a workspace inference API key, current model permissions, composed workspace/key model and Provider grants, an enabled selectable credential and eligible Provider or matching personal owner. Only the explicitly configured fastrouter-actions-v1 model channel is supported. Opaque Provider references, credentials, private source URLs and upstream raw responses are never returned. Reads locally saved metadata only; unknown operation states require explicit reconciliation.

Operation: `get_operationProviderAsset`.

## Authentication

Use the credential and permission scope described above. Each object below is an alternative; schemes within one object are required together.

```json
[
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  },
  {
    "niuApiKeyAuth": []
  }
]
```

## HTTP request

Set `NIU_ORIGIN` to your installation origin (without `/v1`). Replace path, query and header placeholders with the required values. Query examples use curl 7.87 or newer to encode values with `--url-query`. Use the credential scope described above; a bearer token must have the authority required by this operation.

Authentication alternative: `bearerAuth`.

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -X GET "$NIU_ORIGIN/v1/media/operations/{id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NIU_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  --url-query 'model=<MODEL>'
```

Authentication alternative: `niuApiKeyAuth`.

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -X GET "$NIU_ORIGIN/v1/media/operations/{id}" \
  -H "X-Niu-API-Key: $NIU_API_KEY" \
  --url-query 'model=<MODEL>'
```
